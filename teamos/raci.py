"""RACI health checks — deterministic and explainable, no LLM.

A RACI matrix is only useful if someone checks it for the failure patterns that
quietly break teams. These rules encode the well-known ones so the app can say
*exactly* what's wrong and why — the same "explainable score, can't hallucinate"
philosophy as TeamUp's matcher.

The matrix is stored as ``raci[workstream_id][member_id] = code`` where code is
one of the RACI_CODES keys ("A","R","C","I","").
